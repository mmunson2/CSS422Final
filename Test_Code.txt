JSR Test

* ------ JSR TEST ------

* Matthew's current JSR test, sorry if pushed by accident!
   MOVE.W    #$4E90, $4000   * JSR (A0)
   MOVE.W    #$4E91, $4002   * JSR (A1)
   MOVE.W    #$4E92, $4004   * JSR (A2)
   MOVE.W    #$4E93, $4006   * JSR (A3)
   MOVE.W    #$4E94, $4008   * JSR (A4)
   MOVE.W    #$4E95, $400A   * JSR (A5)
   MOVE.W    #$4E96, $400C   * JSR (A6)
   MOVE.W    #$4E97, $400E   * JSR (A7)


* 3:45 AM build notes:
* This still causes an infinite loop
* Recently fixed JSRs in the print methods, didn't seem to help
* New suspicion is that the loop index isn't being incremented
* Waiting on Ihsan's input on what to do with the bools, we should move them to the PUSH methods instead of the PRINT methods where they're at

   MOVE.W    #$4EB9,$4010     * JSR 1016 (1)
   MOVE.L    #$00001016, $4012 * JSR 1016 (2)
